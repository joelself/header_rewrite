    <h2><a href="#who">Who runs this thing?</a></h2>

    <p>
    Hi, I'm <a href="http://jself.io/">Joel Self</a>.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="why" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#why">Why is this necessary? Can't I just load files from GitHub/Dropbox/Bitbucket/FilesAnywhere/Launchpad directly?</a></h2>

    <p>
    When you request a file from one of those sources, they usually serve it (in the case of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and some other file types) with a <code>Content-Type</code> of <code>text/plain</code>. As a result, most modern browsers won't actually interpret it as JavaScript, HTML, or CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
    They do this to discourage people from using their repos and file storage accounts for static file hosting.
    </p>

    <p>
    RawEverything acts as a caching proxy, forwarding requests to the providers, caching the responses either for a short time (in the case of <code>{{config.devDomain}}</code> URLs) or permanently (in the case of <code>{{config.cdnDomain}}</code> URLs), and relaying them to your browser with the correct <code>Content-Type</code> headers.
    </p>

    <p>
    The caching layer ensures that minimal load is placed on the provider, and you get quick and easy static file hosting right from a repo or storage account. Everyone's happy!
    </p>

<div id="associated-with-github" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#associated-with-github">Is RawEverything associated with GitHub/Dropbox/Bitbucket/FilesAnywhere/Launchpad?</a></h2>

    <p>
    No, RawEverything is not associated with GitHub/Dropbox/Bitbucket/FilesAnywhere/Launchpad in any way. Please don't contact those providerrs asking for help with RawEverything. They'll give you a weird look and back away slowly.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="associated-with-rawgit" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#associated-with-rawgit">Is RawEverything associated with RawGit?</a></h2>

    <p>
    Absolutely. The code originally came from RawGit which was written by <a href="http://wonko.com/">Ryan Grove</a>. The RawGit source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/rgrove/rawgit">here</a>.
    </p>

<div id="diff-between-rawgit-and-cdn" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#diff-between-rawgit-and-cdn">What's the difference between {{config.devDomain}} and {{config.cdnDomain}} URLs?</a></h2>

    <p>
    When you make a request to a <code>{{config.devDomain}}</code> URL, the RawEverything server loads the requested file from the provider, serves it to your browser with the correct <code>Content-Type</code> header, and caches it for a short time. If you push new changes to GitHub, you can reload and see them within a few minutes, which makes <code>{{config.devDomain}}</code> useful for low-traffic testing or sharing demos during development.
    </p>

    <p>
    Requests to <code>{{config.cdnDomain}}</code> are cached <strong>permanently</strong> the first time they're loaded. This results in the best performance and reduces load on RawEverything and on the providers, but it means that reloading won't fetch new changes from the provider.
    </p>

    <p>
    During development, when traffic is low and freshness is more important than performance, use <code>{{config.devDomain}}</code>. For anything you share with the public or push to production, use <code>{{config.cdnDomain}}</code>.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="raweverything-com-in-production" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#raweverything-com-in-production">Can I use a {{config.devDomain}} URL on a production website?</a></h2>

    <p>
    No. Please use <code>{{config.cdnDomain}}</code> for anything that might result in heavy traffic. Only use <code>{{config.devDomain}}</code> URLs for low-traffic testing and sharing temporary examples or demos during development. When people misuse <code>{{config.devDomain}}</code>, it costs me money. Please don't be a jerk.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="what-happens-to-jerks" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#what-happens-to-jerks">What will happen if I send large amounts of traffic to a {{config.devDomain}} URL?</a></h2>

    <p>
    First, requests will be throttled and your site will start to load very slowly. If the traffic continues even after automatic throttling is triggered, {{config.devDomain}} will start serving an error page instead of the requested file. If traffic reaches truly excessive levels, then an error message may be displayed directly on your website asking your users to notify you of the problem.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is designed to get your attention as quickly as possible before the excessive traffic  becomes a major problem for RawEverything and starts costing me large amounts of money or impacting other users of this service.
    </p>

    <p>
    Remember, only use <code>{{config.cdnDomain}}</code> in production; never <code>{{config.devDomain}}</code>.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="how-do-i-know-if-im-a-jerk" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#how-do-i-know-if-im-a-jerk">How can I tell if I'm sending too much traffic to {{config.devDomain}}?</a></h2>

    <p>
    If you have to ask this question, you're probably sending too much traffic. Are you on the <a href="/stats#files">Top Files</a> or <a href="/stats#referrers">Top Referrers</a> lists? If so, you may want to back off a bit or use <code>{{config.cdnDomain}}</code> instead.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="cdn-ttl" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#cdn-ttl">How long does the CDN cache files? How can I make it refresh my file?</a></h2>

    <p>
    The CDN caches files permanently based on their path. It ignores query strings. This is done both to improve performance and to make it possible for the CDN to handle massive amounts of traffic without causing excessive load on RawEverything or providers' servers.
    </p>

    <p>
    To ensure that the CDN always serves the version of the file you want when using a source repo, use a tag or commit ref in the file's path instead of a branch name, and update the URL if you push a new version of the file.
    </p>

    <p>
    So, instead of a URL like <code>https://{{config.cdnDomain}}/user/repo/branch/file</code>, use a URL like <code>https://{{config.cdnDomain}}/user/repo/tag/file</code> or <code>https://{{config.cdnDomain}}/user/repo/commit/file</code>.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="no-uptime-guarantee" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#no-uptime-guarantee">I need guaranteed 100% uptime. Should I use {{config.cdnDomain}}?</a></h2>

    <p>
    Probably not.
    </p>

    <p>
    RawEverything is a free service and cannot provide any uptime or support guarantees, even for <code>{{config.cdnDomain}}</code>. While I do my best to keep things running, things sometimes go wrong. Sometimes there are network or provider issues outside my control, sometimes abusive traffic temporarily affects response times, and sometimes I break things (although I try really hard not to).
    </p>

    <p>
    Since I run RawEverything in my spare time, with my own money it has a budget that's probably less than you pay for coffee in a given month. My goal is to help other open source developers get their projects up and running, but if you need to serve files that are crucial to your business, you should probably pay for a host with well-funded infrastructure and uptime guarantees.

<div id="redirects" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#redirects">I moved a file in my repo and now old RawEverything URLs are broken. Is there any way to redirect to the new file?</a></h2>

    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/joelself/raweverything/wiki/How-to-redirect-a-RawEverything-URL-to-another-URL-file">There sure is</a> (for non-CDN URLs, anyway). But in the future, for source repos, you might want to consider using URLs based on a tag or commit ref rather than a branch, since tags and commits always represent a single point in time and won't break if you move a file later.

<div id="donations" class="question">
    <h2><a href="#donations">Can I donate money/Bitcoin/pie to help you out?</a></h2>

    <p>
    It's super nice of you to offer, but I don't need any donations at this time. RawEverything's server costs are minimal. Thank you though!
